Program to compliment ImageJ's Fiji, a scientific image analysis software.
Provides a CSV of every combination of object distances based on coordinate inputs (obtained from Fiji).
Designed to calculate the distances between fruit flies to measure their sociability after consuming different substances.
However, this program can be used to calculate distances between any other objects as well.

How to Obtain Coordinate Points from Fiji ImageJ:
1. Open Fiji ImageJ and upload desired image.
2. Select the "Multi-point" tool and mark each object. There is no limit to the number of objects you select.
3. Select "File" -> "Save As" -> "XY Coordinates". Save the file to any location.
4. Press "Ctrl + Shift + A" to deselect all coordinate points.
5. Using the "Straight line" tool, draw a line the distance of 1 unit on your image (I.E: 1 cm, 1 inch, etc.).
6. Press "Ctrl + M" to open the "Results" window, and take note of the number under the "Length" tab. This is the length, in pixels, of one unit in your image.

How to Use the Fruit Fly Calculator:
7. You are now done with ImageJ. Open the fruit fly calculator with your browser.
8. In the Fruit Fly Calculator, press the "Choose File" button and upload the XY Coordinates file that you saved from ImageJ.
9. Enter the length of 1 unit that you measured in ImageJ into the appropriate form.
10. Press the "Calculate" button, and the distance between every object will appear. You can copy and paste this data into Sheets, Excel, etc.
